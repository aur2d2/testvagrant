This project takes the input of the weekly allowance for newspaper subscriptions.
A 2D array is created initially to represent the table given in the problem. Then all the rows elements are added and each sum is appended to an array.
In the array, we check all possible combinations that are less than or equal to the target allowance value.

You can run the program in any IDE that supports Python.
